#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering  is the systematic application of engineering principles to the development, maintenance, and management of software systems.
The importance of Software engineering is that it enables the creation of software and systems that power aspects of modern life such as education, communication, healthcare, and so on.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages; the introduction of digital computers brought about programming languages so that humans and the computers could interact.
Introduction to structured programming; this milestone highlights the introduction of programming or writing software in a more structural manner instead of cramming everything together as was done befor. The structured programming emphasized clarity, control structures and modularization.
The rise of agile methodologies; this revolutionized software development by promoting iterative development(step by step), customer collaboration, and flexibility. This shift allowed teams to adapt quickly to changing requirements and deliver software more frequently and effeciently.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning: Identifying the scope, objectives, and feasibility of the project. This phase includes resource allocation, risk management, and project scheduling.
Requirements Gathering: Collecting and documenting functional and non-functional requirements from stakeholders. This phase ensures that the software will meet user needs.
Design: Developing the architecture and design of the software, including system components, data models, and user interfaces. High-level and detailed designs are created in this phase.
Implementation (Coding): Translating the design into actual code by developers. This phase involves writing the source code in the appropriate programming languages.
Testing: Verifying that the software functions correctly and meets the specified requirements. Testing includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.
Deployment: Releasing the software to the production environment where users can access it. This phase includes installation, configuration, and training.
Maintenance: Addressing any issues that arise after deployment, including bug fixes, updates, and enhancements. Maintenance ensures the software continues to operate effectively.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall methodology is a linear and sequential approach to software development, where each phase must be completed before the next begins, making it rigid and inflexible to changes once the project is underway. It involves heavy documentation with detailed specifications and is best suited for projects with well-defined requirements, such as government contracts or large infrastructure projects where changes are costly. In contrast, Agile methodology is iterative and incremental, featuring regular feedback loops and high adaptability, allowing changes in requirements even late in the process. Agile prioritizes working software over extensive documentation and is ideal for projects with evolving requirements, such as web or mobile applications driven by user feedback.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer:  Writing, testing, and maintaining code to implement software solutions based on design specifications. Their responsibilities include developing features, fixing bugs, optimizing performance, and collaborating with other team members to ensure the software meets requirements.
Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: Ensures that the software meets quality standards and is free from defects. Responsibilities include creating and executing test plans, identifying bugs, verifying fixes, and ensuring that the final product meets user expectations.
Project Manager: Oversees the software development process, ensuring that the project stays on track and meets deadlines. Their responsibilities include planning, resource allocation, risk management, stakeholder communication, and ensuring that the team adheres to the project timeline.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):
Importance: IDEs provide a comprehensive environment for coding, debugging, and testing, which streamlines the development process. They often include features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and integrated debugging tools.
Examples: Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse.

Version Control Systems (VCS):
Importance: VCS allows teams to manage changes to the source code over time, track revisions, and collaborate efficiently. It is essential for maintaining the integrity of the codebase, especially in large, distributed teams.
Examples: Git, Subversion (SVN), Mercurial.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and delays in projects. Using the agile methodology would be of help, so that developers do not have to start all over if the requirements change.
Handling Tight Deadlines: Meeting project deadlines can lead to stress and burnout. To mitigate this, developers must prioritize tasks, break down work into manageable pieces, and communicate openly with the team to adjust timelines if necessary.
Technical debt: Technical debt arises when quick fixes or less-than-ideal solutions are implemented to meet short-term goals, often under tight deadlines. Although they might work for a while, they could create underlying issues in the codebase that can lead to more significant challenges later, such as difficulties in adding new features, higher chances of bugs, and escalating maintenance costs. A strategy would be to regularly refactor code to improve its structure, optimize performance, and remove inefficiencies

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Tests individual components or functions of the software in isolation to ensure they work as expected.
Importance: Helps catch bugs early in the development process, making it easier to identify and fix issues.

Integration Testing: Tests the interaction between different components or modules of the software to ensure they work together correctly.
Importance: Ensures that integrated components function as a whole, catching issues that unit tests might miss.

System Testing: Tests the entire system as a whole, verifying that all components work together and the system meets the specified requirements.
Importance: Validates the overall functionality and performance of the system in a production-like environment.

Acceptance Testing: Conducted to determine whether the software meets user needs and requirements, often performed by the end-users or clients.
Importance: Ensures that the software meets the acceptance criteria and is ready for deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining input prompts to elicit specific, desired responses from AI models, such as large language models. Effective prompt engineering is crucial for getting accurate, relevant, and contextually appropriate outputs from AI systems. It involves understanding how the AI interprets and processes input to maximize the quality of the generated responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: "Tell me about software."
Improved Prompt: Act as an expert software developer and explain the different types of software, such as system software, application software, and programming software, and provide examples of each"
Explanation: The improved prompt is more effective because it is specific about the types of software being asked about and requests examples, which guides the AI to provide a more detailed and relevant response.
